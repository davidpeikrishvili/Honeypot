# Honeypot Assignment
**Time spent: 11 hours spent in total

**Objective:** Create a honeynet using MHN-Admin. Present your findings as if you were requested to give a brief report of the current state of Internet security. Assume that your audience is a current employer who is questioning why the company should allocate anymore resources to the IT security team.

### MHN-Admin Deployment (Required)
**Summary:**  I used the GCP terminal to download and initialize all the required scripts/files/etc.... I just followed the Milestone steps until Milestone 3 where I had to use the admin panel to create new VMs and add honeypots to them.

### Dionaea Honeypot Deployment (Required)
**Summary:**  Dionaea honeypot is basically a way to retreive the malware that is coming through to the user. In other words it tracks and takes the malware coming from a network and traps it.

### Database Backup (Required) 


Both the Gifs use the same method to initialize the VM and set up the honeypot. I skipped the downloading phase because it took up time and it made the gifs larger.
The ones that I used were
- 2 Dionaea
- 2 Amun
- 1 Cowrie
